Here are over three hundred quotations from over two hundred well-loved children's books, such as <i>Charlotte's Web</i>, <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, <i>Eloise</i>, <i>Sounder</i>, <i>Number the Stars</i>, and <i>Goodnight Moon</i>, organized by topic, among them Acceptance, Goodness, Family Woes, and Growing Old. On Silence: \"I assure you that you can pick up more information when you are listening than when you are talking.\"--E. B.White, <i>The Trumpet of the Swan</i>. On Reverence: \"Dying's part of the wheel, right there next to being born. . . . Being part of the whole thing, that's the blessing.\"--Natalie Babbitt, <i>Tuck Everlasting</i>.<br /><br />With clever illustrations from Pierre Le-Tan, here is a book to share with a friend or keep by your own bedside. It's the perfect gift for your sister, your mother, your brother, your nephew, your kid's teacher, your daughter away at college, your son in the Navy, your mailman, your priest, for the old lady next door, or for the baby just born. Most importantly, give it to yourself. It will help you remember why you loved reading in the first place.","format":"Hardcover","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1561754.What_the_Dormouse_Said","authors":[{"author_id":"2982821","role":""},{"author_id":"3080","role":""}],"publisher":"Algonquin Books","num_pages":"146","publication_day":"10","isbn13":"9781565122413","publication_month":"1","edition_information":" ","publication_year":"1999","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1561754.What_the_Dormouse_Said","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","book_id":"1561754","ratings_count":"18","work_id":"197743"}
